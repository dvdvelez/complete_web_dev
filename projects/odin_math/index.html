        The "viewport" is the user's visible area of a web page. The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen. It is part of the Responsive Web Design methodolgy. Therefore, the meta viewport tag should be used on all websites and is mandatory if you want a good user experience.
            Additionally, you may also need to use media queries to change CSS for different screen widths, like collapsing a menubar into a hamburger menu for smaller screen sizes such as those of a smartphone and etc. 
    
        The "width=device-width" is self explanatory...it changes the screen according to the device's screen size.
        
        The "initial-scale=1.0" means that the initial zoom level of the webpage is 1 or default.

        The "user-scalable=yes" means that zoom-in/zoom-out is allowed for the webpage.
